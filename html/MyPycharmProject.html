                    <p>Here is my pycharm pumpkin project. The goal of this project was to take 
                        lines of data from one file and convert it into data that anyone could read on another file.</p>

                            <h3>Lines of data</h3>
                            <p>As you can see here, we have a file with the names of stores along with long lines of numbers. 
                                Surprisingly, this data actually means something, and it's my program's job to convert this data 
                                into something anybody could read.</p>

                            <h3>The Program</h3>
                            <p>Here is a snippet of just a small portion of my program. The job of this program was to read 
                                the data from the original file and convert it into readable data. My program was able to take 
                                the first letter of this data and match it to its counterpart. It then takes the numbers, the first 
                                three being how many pumpkins each store bought, and the last three numbers being the price they bought 
                                the pumpkins for, and again converts this data onto a new file.</p>

                            <h3>The Outcome</h3>
                            <p>And here is the outcome: as you can see, my program converted the old data into something easy for 
                                anyone to understand. The new data shows the store name, the location, the amount of pumpkins each 
                                store bought, the price they spent per pumpkin, and the total amount spent on pumpkins. My program also 
                                shows the subtotals of each company and the grand totals of all the stores combined. I'm pretty proud of 
                                this program, which was one of the first major programs I ever built.</p>
