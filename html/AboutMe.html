                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Keith Roberts, and I hope you are enjoying my website. I had a lot of fun creating this site, 
                    and it makes me happy when others get to see and experience something I have created. Anyway, here is some 
                    interesting stuff about me. I was born in Bozeman, Montana, in the year 2002. And I lived there until I was 
                    eight years old, when my family decided to pack up and move to Ottumwa, Iowa, where I live now. I attended Ottumwa 
                    High School and graduated in 2021. After graduating, I had no idea what I wanted to be. I always had multiple passions 
                    in life, but I was always afraid to just pick one. But I can't live in a purgatory of choices forever, so one day I 
                    thought, You know what? Ive always enjoyed playing video games, and Ive always been more interested in creating a video 
                    game. I have even created a few smaller, unpublished games in the past for fun, so why don't I give it a shot? Why not try 
                    to create games for a living? And that led me to join Indian Hills Community College, where I am currently studying to become 
                    a software engineer and to give myself enough experience to eventually move on into the gaming industry!</p>
