                            <h3>The Idea</h3>
                            <p>At first, this website just started out as an idea. My instructor had rules for what 
                                the website was supposed to be, but outside of these rules, I was free to do whatever 
                                I wanted with my website. After researching and thinking about ideas for what I wanted 
                                my website to look like, I decided on a clean, minimalistic look and came up with blue 
                                prints like the one shown above.</p>

                            <h3>The Pages</h3>
                            <p>It was time to start creating the pages, which are the outline of this website. 
                                The pages were a little difficult at first to create, being that I didn't know 
                                exactly where to start. But once I got started, it all came to me, and after a 
                                lot of hours, I had my pages set up. It was a long process having to type each 
                                line of code, but in the end, it was definitely worth it.</p>

                            <h3>The Design</h3>
                            <p>Now it was time to design the website. I had everything there in my pages, but it 
                                looked horrible! In the picture above, you can see I am designing my website on 
                                something called a stylesheet, which is used for the design of the website. I 
                                had to make sure every line of code matched up with the individual lines of code
                                 in the pages, or nothing would work. But in the end, after hours and hours of 
                                 work, I got through it, and my website was created.</p>
